# (Prosper Loan Dataset Exploration)
## by (Abdulaziz Otaif)


## Dataset

> The prosper loan dataset contains over 100k loan data and has over 80 columns including borrowing rates and yields associated with each loan, loan term and category, borrower data, and even the number of investors in each loan, and many more features.


## Summary of Findings

> - Lender yield and the estimated loss are correlated, as lender yield goes higher, the estimated loss tends to go higher as well.
> - Professionals are at the top as the occupation with the highest number of loans, followed by computer programmers, executives, teachers, adminitrative assistants, and analysts. Surprisingly, students are at the bottom of the list.
> - The majority of the loans are repaid over 36 months, almost a quarter of the loans are repaid over 60 months, and only 1% are repaid over 12 months.
> - On average, the borrower APR tends to be the highest for loan listings in the middle of the year, and decreases as approaches the end of the year.
> - The prosper score tends to be on average the lowest for loan listings in the middle of the year, and increases as approaches the end of the year.
> - The average number of investors per loan listing tends to be the highest between February and May and decreases gradually as approaches the end of the year.
> - The average amount of loans borrowed tends to be the lowest in the middle of the year, and tends to be the highest in the end/beginning of the year.
> - Most self-employed borrowers tend to have lower prosper scores or higher risk, there are few self-employed borrowers who have high prosper scores compared to other types of employment status. Full-time employees have the opposite distribution, most full-time employees tend to have higher prosper scores or lower risk.
> - Longer loan terms are associated with larger loan amounts, in other words, as loan amount increases, loan terms tend to increase as well, which makes sense.
> - Borrowers from Maine and Iowa tend to have relatively lower borrowing APRs compared to other states.
> - The number of investors in loans borrowed by homeowners is higher than non-homeowners in almost all employment statuses.
> - Borrowing rates are slightly lower for homeowners in all employment statuses except for those who are not employed.
> - Borrowing rates for 12-month loans are the lowest in all listing categories.
> - The estimated returns are the highest for 60-month loans and the lowest for 12 months loans in all listing categories.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> - Loans listed at the beginning/end of the year have lower borrowing rates, on average but have a slightly higher risk from a lender perspective.
> - Most self-employed borrowers tend to have a higher risk compared to other employment statuses, while most employed borrowers tend to have a lower risk. This is probably why most of the loans (over 80%) are lent to employed borrowers.
> - Higher yields are positively correlated with higher losses, "high-risk, high-return".
> - While short-term loans (12 months) provide the best borrowing rates, the best returns come from long-term loans (60 months) from a lender perspective.
> - Homeownership makes a difference from an investor perspective since the number of investors in loans lend to homeowners is higher than non-homeowners. It also makes a difference in borrowing rates, on average, homeowners get lower rates except for unemployed borrowers.
